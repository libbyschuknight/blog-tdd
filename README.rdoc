== BLOG - TDD
Rails Project - Phase 3 of [Enspiral Dev Academy](http://devacademy.co.nz/)
Followed test driven development to create this basic blog app.
In ajax-stuff branch I have added some basic stylying (as I can't cope with the ugly style that you get with Rails) and have added some functiontily to adding a comment on an article page with JS, jQuery and AJAX calls.
